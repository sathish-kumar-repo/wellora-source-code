      <Para>
        An abstract class is a class marked with the abstract keyword. It,
        contrary to non-abstract class, may contain abstract -
        implementation-less - methods(An abstract class may contain abstract
        methods (methods without code or body)). It is, however, valid to create
        an abstract class without abstract methods.
      </Para>
      <Para>
        An abstract class cannot be instantiated. It can be sub-classed
        (extended) as long as the sub-class is either also abstract, or
        implements all methods marked as abstract by super classes.
      </Para>
      <Para>
        Abstraction can be achieved with either abstract classes or interfaces .
